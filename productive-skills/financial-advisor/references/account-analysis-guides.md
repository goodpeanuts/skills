Rank accounts from most to least liquid:
1. Cash (most liquid)
2. Financial
3. Credit (available credit = liquidity)
4. Virtual
5. Claims (illiquid)
6. Investments (varies)
7. Insurance (not liquid)

```
Net Worth = (Cash + Financial + Virtual + Claims + Investments + Insurance Cash Value)
          - (Debt + Credit Balances)
```

### Debt-to-Asset Ratio

```
Debt-to-Asset = (Debt + Credit Balances) / Total Assets × 100%
```

**Target:** <30% healthy, <50% acceptable, >70% danger
