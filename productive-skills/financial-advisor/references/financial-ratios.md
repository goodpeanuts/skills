## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Liquidity Assessment

**Data:**
- Cash: ¥15,000
- Financial Accounts: ¥45,000
- Virtual Accounts: ¥5,000
- Available Credit: ¥30,000
- Credit Card Balances: ¥8,000
- Monthly Expenses: ¥10,000

**Calculations:**
```
Current Ratio = (15,000 + 45,000 + 5,000 + 30,000) / 8,000
             = 95,000 / 8,000
             = 11.9 (Excellent)

Quick Ratio = (15,000 + 45,000) / 8,000
           = 60,000 / 8,000
           = 7.5 (Excellent)

Emergency Fund = (15,000 + 45,000) / 10,000
               = 60,000 / 10,000
               = 6 months (Excellent)
```

### Example 2: Debt Assessment

**Data:**
- Total Liabilities: ¥80,000
- Total Assets: ¥250,000
- Monthly Debt Payments: ¥3,000
- Monthly Income: ¥15,000
- Credit Card Balance: ¥8,000
- Credit Limits: ¥50,000

**Calculations:**
```
Debt-to-Asset = 80,000 / 250,000 × 100%
              = 32% (Good)

DTI = 3,000 / 15,000 × 100%
    = 20% (Good)

Credit Utilization = 8,000 / 50,000 × 100%
                   = 16% (Good)
```

### Example 3: Growth Assessment

**Data:**
- Current Net Worth: ¥170,000
- Previous Net Worth: ¥150,000
- Annual Savings: ¥36,000
- Investment Returns: ¥8,000
- Total Assets: ¥250,000

**Calculations:**
```
Net Worth Growth = (170,000 - 150,000) / 150,000 × 100%
                 = 13.3% (Excellent)

Savings Rate = 36,000 / (15,000 × 12) × 100%
             = 20% (Good)

ROA = 8,000 / 250,000 × 100%
